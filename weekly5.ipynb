    "Now that we've introduced the big computational tools, it's time to start using them to analyze some real-world data sets. In this week's notebook you'll analyze some summary statistics for a data set, understand how they differ, and think about what they each measure.\n",

    "This week, we'll work with GDP (gross domestic product) data, which gives a measurement of the total economic activity of a region. The source we'll use is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/national-gdp-constant-usd-wb?tab=table&time=latest), which also has [really nice interactive charts](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/national-gdp-constant-usd-wb). I've cleaned the data set very slightly to remove empty data; the raw data is in `gdp_data.csv` and we can import it into Python:\n"
