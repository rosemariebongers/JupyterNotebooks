Welcome to JupyterHub for Math 32 (Fall 2023)! This is where we'll be hosting the notebooks that contain simulations and code. Some of the notebooks focus on illustrating or extending a concept from class, and some of the notebooks will be used for experimentation and simulation during your weekly homeworks. 

When you open a notebook, you'll see a mix of markdown (i.e. text -- like this file!) and code written in Python. If you every want to execute a cell, you can either click the execution button or use `ctrl-click` / `cmd-click` after clicking on the cell. 

You can also freely modify the code in any cells; don't worry about changing things, because you can always access the original notebook; it's pulled directly from a github repository ([email me](mailto:rosemariebongers@ucmerced.edu) if you want to learn more about how this is set up!).
